This project simulates network traffic to visualize real-time data flow and detect security anomalies based on predefined thresholds. It uses Python, specifically leveraging the Plotly library for real-time graphing, to mimic typical network behavior with occasional traffic spikes. The system monitors these spikes and triggers alerts when the traffic exceeds a certain threshold. This technical documentation will break down each part of the code, explaining its purpose, functionality, and relevance to real-world scenarios
